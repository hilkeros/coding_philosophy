/* The traditional return statement of a React function is what matters the most to me as a human, but it is completely at the bottom of the file. 
I think it should be at the top, written by humans, in a rather abstract form. The AI/code compiler can create the rest:
- define which props the function needs and do all the type checking
- write much of the javascript logic, which is most of the time very predictable
- add all the imports needed

I think this should also be the information structure of the file: going from the abstract concept to the concrete implementation, with all the supporting libraries mentioned last.
The premise that everything should be defined first (hence, first the imports) before it can be used in code, is very much a machine's need. That is not how a human brain works (at least, mine).
We state something first without filling out all the details. Then we go on with specifying the details. AI will probably be much faster in clarifying the details. But let's write in our code editor
what makes most sense for us as humans, and forget about the old machine habits we developed.  */
